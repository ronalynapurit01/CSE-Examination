The code is a simple simulation of a GPS tracker that keeps track of a user’s position on a two-dimensional grid. At the start, the user’s position is set at the origin (0,0). The program then repeatedly asks the user to input a direction: north, south, east, or west. Each direction updates the position by adjusting the x or y coordinate accordingly. For example, moving north increases the y value, while moving south decreases it. Similarly, moving east increases the x value, and moving west decreases it. After each valid move, the program displays the new position so the user can see where they are on the grid. If the user enters an invalid input, the program warns them and asks again without changing the position. The loop continues until the user types STOP, which ends the session. Finally, the program shows the last position and checks if the user returned to the origin (0,0) or not.
