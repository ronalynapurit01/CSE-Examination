# CSE-Examination

The program starts at the position (0,0) and asks the user to enter a direction such as N, S, E, W, or STOP. If the user types "N" or north, the position moves upward by increasing the `y` value. If the user enters "S" or south, the position moves downward by decreasing the `y` value. Choosing "E" or east makes the position move right by increasing the `x` value, while "W" or west moves it left by decreasing the `x` value. If the input is not valid, the program shows an error message and asks the user again. After every correct move, it prints the new current position on the grid. When the user types STOP, the program ends the loop and displays the final position. It then checks if the userâ€™s final position is back at the origin `(0,0)`. If the user returned to the origin, the program says so. If not, it tells the user that they did not return to the origin.
